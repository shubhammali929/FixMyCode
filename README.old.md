# FixMyCode

Scope:
  1. Code Editor: Develop a web-based code editor using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where users can paste their code.
  2. Code Operations: Implement buttons that allow users to perform various code operations, such as debugging,
    fixing indentation, changing variable names to meaningful ones, and adding comments to the code or even
    optimizing their code.
  3. Code Transformation: Utilize the OpenAI Codex API to perform code transformations based on the user's
    selections. The API will be responsible for making the actual code changes.
  4. User Authentication: Provide two options for users: signing in and continuing without signing in. Implement user
    authentication using technologies like OAuth, Firebase, or a custom backend system.
  5. Code History: If a user signs in, store the code history in a database (e.g., Firebase Realtime Database or
    MongoDB). Display this history in a "History" tab, allowing users to revisit their past code transformations.

Objectives:
  1. To create a user-friendly web application that assists developers in optimizing and improving their code.
  2. To integrate the OpenAI Codex API for code transformation.
  3. To implement user authentication for a personalized experience.
  4. To provide a code history feature for signed-in users to track their code improvements over time.
     
Technologies (May change)
  1. Front-end:
    • HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For creating the user interface and code editor.
    • CodeMirror or Ace Editor: Libraries for embedding a code editor.
    • React: Framework to build dynamic user interfaces.
    • Axios or Fetch API: To make API requests to your server and the OpenAI Codex API.
    • Loading Animation Library: Use libraries like Lottie or CSS animations for loading animations.
  2. Back-end :
    • Node.js or Python as a server-side language.
    • Express.js : Web framework for building server-side logic.
    • Database (Firebase Realtime Database or MongoDB): To store user data and code history for authenticated
      users.
    • Authentication library (Firebase Authentication or Auth0): For user sign-in functionality.
  3. OpenAI Codex API:
    • Integrate the Codex API to perform code transformations based on user input.
  4. User Authentication:
    • OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub) or custom authentication.
    • Firebase Authentication, Auth0, or custom authentication system.
  5. Deployment:
    • Hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, AWS, etc.): To deploy your web application.
    • Domain name (fixmycode.online): For a professional touch.
